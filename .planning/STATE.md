## Accumulated Context

### Decisions

Decisions are logged in PROJECT.md Key Decisions table.
Recent decisions affecting current work:

- Brownfield: System has ~3,400 lines of existing code. Phases fix broken connections, not add new features.
- Fix order mandatory: Phase 1 (pipeline) → Phase 2 (modify) → Phase 3 (save). Cannot reorder.
- AutoSave concern: Current delete-all + re-insert strategy is O(n²). Address in Phase 3 with upsert-by-id.
- Google Drive upload silently fails — surfaced in Phase 5 when Excel output is implemented.

### Pending Todos

None yet.

### Blockers/Concerns

- Voice flow state machine (voiceFlow.ts) has stateRef/useState desync risk — must stabilize in Phase 1.
- P매트릭스 RLS fallback to zeros still needs verification — create new estimate and check unit costs non-zero.
- EstimateEditor.tsx is 389 lines (violates 200-line rule) — split during Phase 3 refactor.
